# Dockerfile
# This file defines the blueprint for our secure, isolated Python sandbox.
# The code generated by the LLM will be executed inside a container
# created from this image, protecting the host machine.

# Start from a lightweight, official Python base image.
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set a working directory inside the container to keep things organized.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy ONLY the requirements file into the container.
# The .dockerignore file prevents the rest of the project from being copied,
# ensuring a small, fast, and secure build context.
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the Python dependencies needed for data analysis.
# --no-cache-dir keeps the final image size smaller.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# The default command when the container starts. This will be overridden
# by our application with the specific script to run.
